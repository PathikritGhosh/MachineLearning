This code is in completion of the programming assignment : Sparse Autoencoder. It is done as a part of the course CS294A(Stanford University). The idea of this code is to detect edges in images using the concept of Sparse autoencoders and backpropagation algorithm. L-BFGS has been used for the purpose of parameter optimization. train.m calls all the relevant functions for the entire process. It has been implemented such that eventually we get a visualization of the hidden nodes(hard coded to 25 but can be changed or taken as an argument) and how the hidden nodes capture edges in the images.
